# An-Automated-Machine-Learning-Approach-for-Smart-Waste-Management-Systems

### Objective
To identify and investigate several solutions in existing waste management systems for determining whether a container was emptied.

### Methodology
1. Import the libraries and load the dataset.
2. Pre-processing the data
   - Identifying  and handling the missing values.
   - Encoding the categorical data
   - Feature scaling
3. Using machine learning algorithms to the problems to get better results.

### Algorithms Used
-  K - Nearest Neighbor Classifier
-  Support Vector Machine
-  Logistic Regression 
-  Decision Tree 
-  MLP Neural Network 
-  Random Forest
